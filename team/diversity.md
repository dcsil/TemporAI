# Diversity in TemporAI

TemporAI turns complexity into lasting intelligence. Building adaptable AI requires more than technical excellence, it demands perspectives shaped by different cultures, languages, disciplines, and lived experiences. This document outlines our team’s background, strengths and weaknesses, areas where subject-matter experts can help, our diversity profile, and how gaps may impact our company, team, and product.

## Team Background  

Our team spans **computer science, data science, information systems, and industrial & systems engineering**, with experience across backend systems, AI/ML, product management, design, optimization, and entrepreneurship.  

- **Advaith Karthikeyan** — Industrial & Systems Engineering (NUS): optimization/operations research, ROS2/robotics integration, data pipelines, analytics dashboards, consulting leadership; strong customer-oriented thinking and structured analysis.  
- **Kaiser Cheng** — Data Science (NUS): AI engineering and product experimentation (IBM, YCS23), cloud & data platforms (AWS, S3/Athena/Lambda/DynamoDB), LLM evaluation and RAG workflows; bridges feasibility with innovation.  
- **Mohamed Sbeinati** — Computer Science—Entrepreneurship (UofT): full-stack development (Go/TS/React/Django), operations and business leadership (retail/wholesale); emphasizes adoption, GTM, and product-market fit.  
- **Sophie Luo** — Information Systems (NUS): product management, UI/UX, marketing, venture/startup ops; led cross-functional delivery (UAT, roadmaps) and growth initiatives.  
- **Zherui Zhang** — Computer Science (UofT): backend & applied ML at scale (Intuit), testing infra, biomedical ML research; ensures scalable systems and research rigor.  

We collectively speak **English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic, and Tamil**, and have worked/studied across **Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, and broader Asia**.

## Strengths & Weaknesses  

**Strengths**  
- Full product stack coverage: research → design → backend/ML → cloud/data → product/GTM.  
- Execution discipline: experience with CI/CD, testing, analytics, A/B testing, and user-acceptance testing.  
- Optimization & scalability: experience with systems handling high event volumes, data models, and latency-sensitive pipelines.  

**Weaknesses**  
- Limited long-horizon industry exposure: fewer years inside enterprises to internalize procurement, compliance, and change-management realities.  
- Gaps in governance and regulation expertise, including AI safety, privacy, and data residency.  
- Strong technical breadth but limited deep specialization in specific market verticals.

## Subject Matter Experts  

To address the above, we plan to engage the following SMEs:  

- **AI Ethics & Governance Advisor** — guide responsible development, establish evaluation protocols, and align with emerging standards.  
- **Privacy & Security Counsel (Data/Cloud)** — map data flows, minimize PII, and ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., PIPEDA, GDPR).  
- **Enterprise GTM/Procurement Mentor** — advise on pilots, security reviews, and procurement processes to ease adoption.  
- **Vertical Domain Advisors** (per target market) — validate real workflows and pain points, helping us design solutions that meet actual customer needs.

## Unconscious Bias  

Real biases we’ve observed in ourselves:   

- **Innovation Bias**: Our backgrounds in AI/ML and systems push us toward novel or complex solutions when users may need simpler, reliable workflows. *This could result in over-engineered features that reduce usability or adoption.*  
  *Mitigation*: We will take a step back during design reviews and consult the instructor to ensure we are focusing on simplicity and solving the actual user need rather than adding unnecessary complexity.
- **Student/Startup Lens**: We optimize for speed and MVP learning loops, which can underweight enterprise constraints (governance, procurement, SOC2-like controls, maintenance burdens). *This risks building products that are exciting but difficult for organizations to adopt long-term.*  
  *Mitigation*: We plan to involve enterprise-experienced mentors and SMEs early, balancing MVP agility with compliance and governance needs.  
- **Global-but-Urban Bias**: Our hub experience (Toronto/Singapore) may bias us toward assuming high connectivity and digital literacy. *This could exclude rural, low-bandwidth, or less tech-experienced users from fully benefiting from our product.*  
  *Mitigation*: We will simulate constrained scenarios during testing as much as possible, and seek occasional feedback from users with different access conditions to broaden our perspective.

## Diversity  

**What we bring**  
- **Languages & cultures**: English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic, Tamil; experience across North America and Asia.  
- **Academic diversity in STEM**: CS, IS, Data Science, Industrial & Systems Engineering (optimization, robotics, analytics, design, PM).  
- **Work modes**: exposure to research labs, hospitals, startups (including YC-backed), venture studios, and enterprise teams.  

**Where we are limited**  
- Concentrated age/education band: all current students/early-career; few long-tenured enterprise operators.  
- Limited perspectives outside STEM, with room for improvement in gender balance. We also lack lived experience from underrepresented groups in tech — including ethnic minorities, newcomers navigating local systems, or people with disabilities. This may reduce our ability to anticipate accessibility needs or challenges faced by users from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

**How this can impact us**  
- Empathy gaps: risk of optimizing for technically literate, well-resourced users.  
- Adoption friction: underestimating organizational change, trust, and accountability features (auditability, override controls).  
- Blind spots in harm: failure modes (bias, over-reliance on automation, explainability gaps) may go undetected without diverse testers and advisors.  

**Why different backgrounds help in our AI theme**  
- **Model robustness**: broader data perspectives improve evaluation coverage and reduce hidden failure modes.  
- **Product fit**: culturally aware design increases trust and adoption across markets.  
- **Responsible scaling**: governance and accessibility expertise reduce risk while enabling enterprise growth.
