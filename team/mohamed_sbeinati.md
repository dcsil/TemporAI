## About Mohamed  

Mohamed is a fourth-year CS student at U of T (Entrepreneurship stream). He splits his time between building full-stack apps and running a fragrance business in Toronto. He enjoys shipping useful things, some of his projects include **QuickSell** (Vision + eBay to speed up listings) and **Touchlink** (a CSC490 prototype where holding hands lights an LED display). He values clear ownership, fast feedback, and keeping solutions simple.  

Outside of tech, Mohamed unwinds by baking, cooking for his roommates, learning French, hunting for late-night movie screenings in Toronto, and trying to keep a semi-regular gym routine.
